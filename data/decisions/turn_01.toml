You've inherited a security disaster. Your predecessor left without documentation. 

You've discovered:
• Flat network - every service talks to every service
• Credentials stored in Slack history
• No SIEM, no IDS
• Internet-facing Jenkins server with 47 known CVEs
• Logging disabled on 60% of systems "to save costs"

Budget allows fixing TWO of four critical issues.

What do you prioritize?
