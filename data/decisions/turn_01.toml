context = """Your predecessor left you a sprawling mess. The previous CISO 'pursued other opportunities' after a nasty vendor breach exposed 50K customer emails. Legal settled quietly. The board wants 'new leadership with fresh ideas.'

You're walking into their first sprint planning of Q1. Engineering is pushing to ship a major feature by end of quarter - a new API that lets enterprise customers bulk-import their user data. Marketing has already announced it. Sales has deals contingent on it.

Your security architect pulls you aside: 'The API has no rate limiting, minimal input validation, and uses the admin service account for all operations. The previous CISO approved it because the vendor promised to fix it post-launch. That was 8 months ago.'

The API goes live in 3 weeks. What do you do?"""
