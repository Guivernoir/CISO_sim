title = "The Compliance Theater"
context = """Board meeting prep: The audit committee wants an update on SOC 2 compliance. Your compliance officer tells you the bad news.

You have 127 findings from the internal pre-assessment. Most are 'minor' - documentation gaps, policy updates, process improvements. But 6 are critical:

1. Production database access logs are deleted after 30 days (SOC 2 requires 1 year)
2. No segregation of duties for infrastructure changes (same person who requests can approve)
3. Vendor risk assessments are 18 months old (should be annual)
4. Your 'encryption at rest' is AWS default encryption (not customer-managed keys)
5. Privileged access reviews happen quarterly (should be monthly)
6. Your incident response plan was last tested in 2022

Your external auditor says you can remediate in 3 months and still get certified on schedule - but only if you go full theater mode:

Option A: Fix everything properly (9 months, $500K, delay certification)
Option B: Fix the optics (3 months, $150K, get certified but still have real gaps)
Option C: Challenge the auditor's interpretation (risky, but some findings are debatable)

The board wants that SOC 2 badge. Sales has 5 enterprise deals waiting on it."""
