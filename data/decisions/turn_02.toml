context = """Your company uses a popular analytics platform (let's call it 'DataFlow') that processes customer behavior data. They just announced a new 'AI Insights' feature that will train models on your customer data to provide 'predictive recommendations.'

Legal forwarded you the updated Terms of Service. Buried in section 14.3(b): DataFlow retains perpetual rights to use aggregated and anonymized data for model training. The anonymization technique? K-anonymity with k=5. Your data scientists say that's trivially reversible with auxiliary information.

The kicker: Your enterprise contract auto-renews with TOS updates unless you opt out within 30 days. Sales loves DataFlow - it's in every demo. Engineering built critical dashboards on it. The CEO personally endorsed it at the last all-hands.

Your privacy counsel is spooked. The new TOS might violate GDPR Article 25 (data protection by design). If regulators notice, that's 4% of global revenue in fines.

What do you do?"""
