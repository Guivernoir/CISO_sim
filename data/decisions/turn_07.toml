title = "The Board Ultimatum"
context = """Emergency board meeting. They've seen the breach notification headlines. Customers are angry. Two enterprise deals were cancelled. ARR is down.

The board has three demands:

1. Fire your SOC lead (the one who called you at 2AM to report the breach)
2. Hire a Big 4 consulting firm to 'restore confidence' ($2M retainer)
3. Issue a public statement that the breach was 'fully contained' and 'no evidence of data misuse'

Your SOC lead is the only reason you caught the breach at all. The Big 4 firm will produce a glossy report and recommend buying their $500K/year managed SOC service. The public statement is... optimistic at best.

Your CEO pulls you aside: 'The board wants a head on a pike. Give them someone or they'll come for yours. We need to show we're taking action.'

Legal adds: 'That public statement is defensible. We have no PROOF of data misuse. Just say it carefully.'

Your integrity score is on the line. So is your job."""
