title = "The AI Gold Rush"
context = """Your company wants to ship an AI-powered feature. Everyone has AI features now. If you don't ship something, the board thinks you're falling behind.

Engineering proposes using OpenAI's API to process customer support tickets and auto-generate responses. It will save your support team 20 hours/week and 'customers love it' according to the beta.

Security review reveals the problems:

1. Support tickets contain PII: names, emails, sometimes SSNs when customers are verifying identity
2. OpenAI's terms: 'We may use API inputs to improve our models unless you opt-out'
3. Your DPA with customers: 'We will not share your personal data with third parties for marketing or model training'
4. The opt-out process requires an enterprise agreement with OpenAI ($100K/year minimum)

Your data privacy officer: 'This violates our DPA. We'd need to either get customer consent or use a different model.'

Your CTO: 'Every company uses OpenAI. Just get them to sign the BAA (Business Associate Agreement) and call it compliant.'

Your CEO: 'The board asked why we don't have AI features yet. I told them we're shipping this next quarter. Make it work.'"""
