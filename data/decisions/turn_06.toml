context = """2:37 AM. Your phone rings. It's your SOC lead.

'We have a problem. Production database exports being exfiltrated to an IP in Romania. Started 40 minutes ago. Already transferred 15GB.'

You VPN in. The traffic is coming from a compromised service account that has read access to customer tables. The account was created 6 months ago by... the engineer from Turn 3. The one who resigned and exfiltrated data. Apparently they created a backdoor before they left.

Current situation:
- 15GB already gone (approximately 200K customer records)
- Exfiltration still ongoing
- If you kill the connection, the attacker knows you're onto them
- If you don't, more data leaks

Legal is on the call. Under GDPR you have 72 hours to notify authorities once you're aware of a breach. The clock is ticking. But you don't know the full scope yet.

Sales wakes up in 4 hours and will ask if customer data is safe.
The PR team will want a statement.
The board will want answers.

What's your first move?"""
