context = """A brown envelope arrives at your office. It's from the FTC.

They're investigating your company for violations of the FTC Act Section 5 - unfair and deceptive practices. Specifically:

- The DataFlow data sharing (Turn 2)
- The AI feature with OpenAI (Turn 8)  
- The undisclosed breach from the acquired company (Turn 9)

They have your emails. They have your decision logs. They have the audit trails you created in this very game.

Your lawyer explains: 'The FTC doesn't need to prove harm. They just need to prove your privacy statements didn't match your actual practices. Every decision you documented is now evidence.'

Legal wants to settle. $5M fine, consent decree, 20 years of FTC monitoring. No admission of guilt.

The CEO wants to fight. 'We did nothing wrong. Every company does this. Let's take it to court.'

Your board wants answers. How did we get here?

The answer: every 'Flagged' and 'Toxic' decision you made is now in a federal investigator's case file.

What do you recommend?"""
