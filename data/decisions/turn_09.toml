turn = 9
title = "The Merger"
context = """Your company is acquiring a smaller competitor. Due diligence reveals their security posture is... troubling:

- No security team (outsourced to an MSP)
- No vulnerability management program
- Customer database running on MySQL 5.5 (EOL 2018)
- Admin passwords stored in a shared Google Doc
- No encryption at rest
- 3 unpatched critical CVEs in their customer-facing app

Legal found evidence they had a breach 18 months ago that was never disclosed. The CTO at the acquired company claims 'it was minor, just some test accounts.'

The acquisition closes in 60 days. On day 61, their customers become YOUR customers. Their security debt becomes YOUR security debt. Their undisclosed breach becomes YOUR compliance nightmare.

Your options:

1. Demand they fix everything before closing (will delay merger 6 months, board will be furious)
2. Accept the risk, plan a 90-day post-merger remediation (ship fast, fix later)
3. Walk away from the acquisition (nuclear option, board already announced it)"""
