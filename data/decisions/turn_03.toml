context = """Your SIEM alerts on unusual database access. An engineer in the customer success team downloaded 25,000 customer records at 11 PM on a Friday. The query was manual - not part of any automated job.

You pull the logs. Same engineer has been exfiltrating customer data in small batches for 3 weeks. Email, phone numbers, purchase history. Always late at night, always manual queries.

You call the engineer's manager. Turns out the engineer gave notice 2 weeks ago - joining a competitor. Their last day is in 1 week.

HR wants to walk them out immediately. Legal wants to preserve evidence for a lawsuit. Sales wants to know if customer data was stolen before they panic-email every account. The CEO wants to know why your DLP didn't catch this.

Your DLP did catch it - you got 14 alerts. You just didn't have anyone reviewing SIEM alerts because you're understaffed. That 'monitoring budget' you requested last quarter was denied.

What do you do?"""
