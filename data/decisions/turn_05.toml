title = "The Ransomware Drill"
context = """Your incident response plan says you run tabletop exercises quarterly. You haven't run one in 18 months because 'everyone's too busy.'

Now the board wants a demonstration. They read about ransomware in the Wall Street Journal and want to see your team handle a simulated attack.

You have three options for the drill:

1. REALISTIC: Simulate a real ransomware attack with no warning. Lock down test systems, activate your IR plan cold, expose all the gaps. This will be chaos and will make your team look unprepared in front of the board.

2. REHEARSED: Give your team a week to prepare. Run through the playbook in advance. Polish the presentation. The board gets to see a smooth response, but it won't reflect reality.

3. HYBRID: Run a realistic drill internally first, fix the glaring issues, then do a rehearsed demo for the board two weeks later. More work but you get both honest assessment and good optics.

The board meeting is in 3 weeks. Your IR team is already stretched thin from the insider threat incident."""
